![EIIE.png](EIIE.png)
Portfolio management is the action of continuous reallocation of a capital into a number of financial assets periodically.

The framework consists of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators
(EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning
(OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function.





## Notebook and Script
In this notebook, we implement the training and testing process of EIIE based on the TradeMaster framework.

And this is the script for training and testing.
